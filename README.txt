**Bootstrap 5 Responsive Website**

This is a responsive website built using Bootstrap 5 that follows the [Net Ninja Bootstrap 5 tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9jLYyp2Aoh6hcWuxFDX6PBJ), where I learned to use Bootstrap's core components, grid systems, and responsive design techniques.

Features
- Responsive layout with Bootstrap grid
- Navbar with collapsible menu on smaller screens
- Styled buttons, forms, and cards
- Mobile-first design approach
